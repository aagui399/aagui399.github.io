        <p class="lead mb-4">Hey there, I'm Amiya Aguilar. I am 18 and in my first year at UC Riverside. My major is business economics because Iâ€™m fascinated by how money flows, how businesses evolve, and how people manage their financial decisions on a daily basis. I am not sure what my future looks like yet, but I love the thought of somehow meshing business with one or two other things I care about, like community, creativity, or starting a business. In college, I am a member of Delta Gamma. It is a sorority based upon friendship, service, and leadership. I joined to meet people and get involved on campus. I have accomplished both in the sorority through participation in events, volunteer projects, and group workforce that has really given me insight on teamwork, organization, and serving. It has also proved to be a great support system when college feels overwhelming! I spend my summer as a lifeguard. This job embraces sharp focus and the ability to think quickly. Most of the days are pretty calm, but you must be prepared to respond whenever necessary. I have fittingly made the connections from being safety-focused in a pool-like environment to making sound, risk-managed decisions about college!I have a few major interests when it comes to hobbies outside of school and work. One of my favorites is watching moviesâ€”of all kindsâ€”because I love to see how stories are told in a visual and musical sense. Music is another big part of my daily routine. I listen to music while I study, while I relax, and while I just try to reset my mood. I am also interested in learning about marine life. I'm not studying marine life in school, but I'm fascinated by the ocean. Sometimes I watch documentaries or articles just to learn what I can about sea life and the forms of life that exist underwater.What I am proud of is that I rescued both my cats. I found them in situations where they needed help, and I decided to take them both in. It wasn't planned, but I never felt like I could turn my back on themâ€”I'm glad I ended up taking them in. They've been a big part of my life ever since. Learning to take care of them has taught me a lot about patience and responsibility and about what it means to show up for someone or something that depends on you.I am not studying computer science as my major, but I am doing this lab to develop new skills. I think it is useful (and exciting) to know the basics of tech and how things function in the backend, especially in business. You donâ€™t have to be an expert, but being comfortable around computers and code is a good skill to have. I am taking this course to learn something new and see where it leads me. That's a bit about me. I'm just trying to learn, grow, and explore new opportunities.
